Today, we're going to learn about the main idea of a story and how to identify the supporting details. I want you not only to find the supporting details but to understand why they are the supporting details. A true learner can not only state the facts but defend them, just like an attorney could defend you. Now, turn to your reading spiral to the section on the main idea. I believe we completed a main idea table. Find that table, or you may have drawn a main idea chair. Take a few minutes to look over your notes and refresh your mind about the main idea. Give me a thumbs up if you understand what the main idea is. If you're not sure, give me a hand in the middle. Okay, hands down. 

Teacher 0:01:10
Now, to those who gave a thumbs up, what is a main idea? 

Teacher 0:01:13
Adrian?

Student Adrian 0:01:14
The main idea is the big picture. It's the overarching theme the story revolves around.

Teacher 0:01:23
You should also have notes on supporting detail in your spiral. What is a supporting detail?

Teacher 0:01:37
Olivia, can you answer that?

Student Olivia 0:01:40
A supporting detail is like a chair; it holds the main idea up.

Teacher 0:01:48
Exactly, Olivia. A supporting detail holds up the main idea. Today, we're going to read a story about a frog and a toad. Your task is to do some visual thinking. Rachel, can you remind us what visual thinking means?

Student Rachel 0:02:09
It's writing down what you think you should remember.

Teacher 0:02:10
That's correct, Rachel. When you're doing visual thinking, you don't say your thoughts out loud. You write them down. And remember, your thoughts don't always have to be questions. They can be statements or comments. Now, please take a sheet from the bucket on your table labeled "Frog and Toad". Begin your visual thinking when I say "prowl".

Teacher 0:03:41
Prowl. Are you guys ready? Remember, if you encounter an unfamiliar word, you can also sort while you read. 

Teacher 0:04:51
I truly enjoyed observing your work. Many of you have already figured out the main idea, which is impressive. Now, if you haven't gotten to that point in your thinking process, take a moment and write down what you think the main idea of "Frog and Toad" is at the bottom of your paper. 

Teacher 0:06:20
I saw some excellent main ideas as I was going around. I think we all have the same thought in mind. Now, when I want to organize my thoughts, what's a good way to do that when I'm discussing the main idea? Isabella?

Student Isabella 0:06:35
A main idea web.

Teacher 0:06:37
Excellent, Isabella. Let's draw a main idea web. We'll label it "Frog and Toad". The main idea goes in the center. Now, who can tell me what the main idea of my story is? Diego, would you like to share?

Student Diego 0:07:11
Frogs and toads have things in common.

Teacher 0:07:30
That's part of it, Diego, but there's more to the main idea. What else can we add?

Student 0:07:45
The main idea is how frogs and toads are different and alike.

Teacher 0:07:45
Exactly. The main idea is about how frogs and toads have things in common and their differences. Now, let's look for some supporting details in the text. I want you to find two details about how they're alike and two about how they're different. You have two minutes to discuss this in your groups. 

Teacher 0:08:33
That's a great point. Write that one down. Make sure to note which paragraph you found the evidence in.

Teacher 0:09:15
So, you've found a few details. Let's discuss them. A frog is smooth, and a toad is bumpy. Those are differences. Maybe we need to state that some differences we found are because of...

Teacher 0:09:36
Yes, exactly right. When you're going back in your text and you're finding your evidence, make sure to note which paragraph you found that evidence in.

Teacher 0:10:16
Have you done a third one yet? No? Okay, looking at Madison's paper, I see the main idea is that frogs and toads have more in common than they have different. So, our main idea is upheld. We're pretty good so far. 

Teacher 0:12:04
Now, let's start with group number four. Give me something they have in common. Jared?

Student Jared 0:12:10
They are both amphibians.

Teacher 0:12:19
Excellent, Jared. And where did you find that in your text? The first paragraph? Great. 

Teacher 0:12:08
Willem, can you tell us something that is different?

Student Willem 0:12:10
Frog's skin is slimy and Toad's skin is warty.

Teacher 0:12:19
Excellent, Willem. And you found that in paragraph three? Great. 

Teacher 0:13:26
Emma, can you tell us another difference between a frog and a toad according to the text?

Student Emma 0:13:26
Dogs can eat frogs, but they can't eat toads.

Teacher 0:13:33
That's right, Emma. When something can be eaten, we can also say it's edible. So, frogs are edible. 

Teacher 0:13:42
We've just finished our graphic organizer, and you all did an excellent job. I loved seeing everyone thinking, working together, listening to each other, and debating. Very good job.
