Teacher 0:00:00: Today, we will shift our focus from observing soil and plants to another component of our terrarium: crickets. We will explore their role in our food chain. Please turn to page 19 in your journals. We will begin by distributing trays with various objects. The materials managers will get a tray, which will contain a container with a cricket. Some containers may have more than one cricket. Each tray will also have four magnifying glasses.

Student 0:01:19: Okay.

Teacher 0:01:22: Once the trays are on your tables, the materials managers can collect the terrarium for their group. There should be one terrarium per group.

Student 0:01:38: Whoa! This is great. A real live cricket! Look how much it's grown.

Teacher 0:01:56: Everyone, give me five. This means your hands should be free and your eyes should be on me. We want to be participants, not just observers.

Student 0:02:10: Okay.

Teacher 0:02:12: We are here to observe, but we also want to actively participate. Now, the first thing we're going to observe are the crickets. I want you to discuss with your partner whether or not you think a cricket is an insect. Please begin your discussions now.

Student 0:02:48: It's an insect because it has claws, antennas, and a thorax. Also, it has three body parts: a head, thorax, and abdomen. A cricket has six legs, antenna, a head, thorax, and abdomen.

Teacher 0:03:25: Give me five again. Make sure you have nothing in your hands and your eyes are on me. We want to remain active participants. Now, what did you decide? Is a cricket an insect? Be prepared to explain why. Isabel, what do you think?

Isabel 0:03:53: I think a cricket is not an insect because most insects have six legs and crickets only have four.

Teacher 0:04:03: So, you believe it only has four legs. Does anyone want to add to what Isabel is saying? Isabel, could you choose someone, please?

Student 0:04:11: I...

Teacher 0:04:14: Do you agree with Isabel?

Student 0:04:16: I don't agree with Isabel because the cricket does have six legs. An insect also has a head, thorax, and abdomen with antennas.

Teacher 0:04:33: Okay, good job. Skylar, would you enlighten us, please?

Skylar 0:04:37: I think a cricket is an insect. Jaylen and I agree that it's an insect because it has six legs.

Teacher 0:04:52: Okay, with that in mind, you've all had excellent conversation and good feedback. Oh, it also has antennas? That's absolutely right. Now, I'd like you to take your magnifiers and observe carefully. You're going to do numbers one and two. Draw a large picture of one of the crickets from your container and use your chart at the bottom to answer question two: Do you think a cricket is an insect? Why or why not? You'll have to prove it with your drawing, and don't forget to label when you draw.

Student 0:05:45: Just put the number nine inside. Go in the side. And then you got antennas. Wait a minute, it looks like another two sets of antennas. What did you say just now? Hey, did you look at your chart?

Teacher 0:06:08: Can you find everything on the chart?

Student 0:06:12: Six, seven, three body parts, and two, four, and ten.

Teacher 0:06:18: I like how you're starting your drawing. Remember to label your drawings. Go ahead and start your drawing.

Student 0:06:26: Finish your drawing, please. You want it turned around? There we go.

Teacher 0:06:35: Did you check and make sure that it has everything that's on the chart?

Student 0:06:40: Yes.

Teacher 0:06:44: Can you draw it for me? Draw and label the parts for me. I like the way you're using your chart to help you. Good job. You're going to draw a line like this and write down what that part is.

Student 0:07:06: Okay?

Teacher 0:07:07: So you're going to name all the parts for me, okay? Boys and girls, give me five. Look at me and give me five. I like the way your hands are free. I like that all eyes are on me. Right, Isaiah? Right, Drake? Thank you. You've been doing some great observations. I'm seeing some wonderful drawings and labeling. You can continue, but I want you to answer number two right now. Let's go ahead and answer number two so we can begin our discussion. You have to tell me if it is an insect or not and why.

Student 0:07:53: Insect. Okay. Go ahead and answer number two, then you can go back to...

Teacher 0:07:59: Who'd like to share their response for number two? Who has it down and would like to share their response? Okay, would you like to take the hot seat? Listen.

Teacher 0:08:28: Excellent. Jay, would you like to read your answer?

Student Jay 0:08:32: The creature is an insect because it has an active thorax, a head, six legs, and antennas. That's why it's an insect.

Teacher 0:08:48: Well done. Let's give Jay the firecracker clap, please. Good job, everyone. Let's sit down. Now, you've identified this creature as an insect and explained why. You mentioned it had three body parts. Can anyone recall one of these body parts? Yes? The thorax? Excellent. Shortly, I'll ask you to show me where it is. Can anyone name another body part you observed? The legs? Good. And another body part?

Student 0:09:31: The little pictures on the walls.

Teacher 0:09:34: Alright, what else did you notice? Isabel?

Student Isabel 0:09:38: The antennae.

Teacher 0:09:41: The antennae, okay. Go on.

Student 0:09:46: The small part near the head.

Teacher 0:09:54: Is it near the head or at the other end?

Student 0:09:58: It's near the head.

Teacher 0:09:59: So, it's near the head? Okay. It's the legs. Now, let's look up here. CJ, you identified the thorax earlier. Could you come up here and show me where it is? Do we all agree that the thorax is between the head and the abdomen? Thumbs up or thumbs down? Does anyone disagree? No? Fantastic. That's absolutely correct. Who can name and show me another body part? Isabel?

Student 0:10:36: Let's move over a little. There you go.

Teacher 0:10:39: The antennae, okay.

Student 0:10:45: The abdomen. 

Teacher 0:10:50: Yes, the abdomen, well done.

Student 0:10:51: The wings.

Teacher 0:10:56: The wings, yes. I noticed that many of you did not include wings in your drawings. Insects do have wings. Good job, everyone. So far, we've identified the antennae, the thorax, the wings. What was the other part we identified? I seem to be forgetting. What was it? The thorax? Okay, who can name another body part? Brian, your turn.

Student Brian 0:11:37: The head.

Teacher 0:11:38: The head, good. Skyler, can you identify another body part we haven't mentioned?

Student Skyler 0:11:46: The abdomen.

Teacher 0:11:48: The abdomen, excellent. Now, I noticed that Drake included another extension in his drawing. Look carefully at your cricket. Does yours have this, it looks like...

Teacher (0:00:00): Observe the end of the stick. Does it have an extension? Some will, some won't. If your cricket has this extension, please raise your hand. If you don't have one, that's perfectly fine. Now, put your crickets down and look up here. This extension is called an ovipositor. It's found on female crickets and functions as a tube to deliver eggs into the ground for fertilization and growth. 

Teacher (0:00:30): Now, I'd like you to turn to page 19. You'll find questions three and four asking you to identify certain body parts on your cricket. If these parts aren't labeled on your cricket, please label them.

Student 1 (0:13:52): I still have a question from earlier. What are those two lines on the back of the cricket?

Teacher (0:13:59): Those lines are called Celia, which are tiny hairs. What do you think their function might be?

Student 1 (0:14:09): Could they help the cricket if it gets lost?

Teacher (0:14:14): Correct, they serve as sensors. They help the cricket feel its surroundings. Have you ever heard the noise crickets make when they rub their legs? These hairs also play a role in that. It's the males that make the noise, not the females. They do this to attract mates.

Teacher (0:15:03): Allie, could you please read the next part?

Student Allie (0:15:03): Gently touch the tip of your pencil to one of the crickets' antenna.

Teacher (0:15:08): Yes, and observe what the cricket does. The leader of each group will perform this task. Please do not stab the antenna, just gently touch it. One person from each group will do this while the rest observe.

Student 1 (0:15:43): But what if I want to touch it too?

Teacher (0:15:49): It's important that only one person does this, while the rest observe. Afterward, write down your observations and be prepared to share. Remember, when you're writing, try to paint a picture with words. I would like the reporter from each team to share their observations. Who is the reporter on this team? Could you please share what you observed?

Teacher 0:16:24: "It just started to run away in a circle."
Student 0:16:27: "It started to run in a circle. Do you have any ideas why that might have happened?"
Teacher 0:16:33: "No."
Student 0:16:35: "No? Okay. Does anybody on your team have an idea? Go ahead."
Teacher 0:16:39: "Because maybe the cricket was thinking that we were trying to threaten it."
Student 0:16:48: "Okay. So by feeling that on his antenna, he thought that might have been a threat, so he's running away. All right. Good thinking. Who is the reporter in this group? Are you the reporter in your group? Can you tell me, can you tell the class what yours did? The cricket jumped and ran around the box."
Teacher 0:17:09: "He almost got out."
Student 0:17:11: "Okay, good. Who is the, thank you. I guess I'm liking your reasoning. I'm liking your responses. Drake? Who is the reporter on this team? You are? Okay. Can you tell us what happened when the pencil was touched to the antenna?"
Teacher 0:17:32: "When we were trying to touch the cricket with the pencil, it kept on running away in circles and we didn't get to touch it because it kept on jumping."
Student 0:17:48: "Okay."
Teacher 0:17:49: "Well, we touched it a couple of times, but when we actually did touch it, there were some times we touched it a couple of times and it stayed still and we tried to touch it again, then the second time we tried to touch it, it ran off."
Student 0:18:01: "Okay. All right. Nice job. Okay. I would like my materials people to come up here. What you're going to do, what the material managers are going to do when they get back to their desks, they're going to fold their piece of construction paper in half. They're going to make a tent. It's going to look like a tent. And we're going to see what happens when we put this little tent inside the container. What do you think the cricket will do? First of all, I want you to turn to someone in your group and I want you to, within your group, talk about, you can go on back, talk about what you think might happen when this is in there."
Teacher 0:18:50: "I think it will give me five. Me too. Give me five."
Student 0:18:59: "Give me five. Give me five. What do you think will happen? What do you think will happen when the tent is placed inside the container? What do you think?"
Teacher 0:19:17: "I thought they would just go inside of it and hide."
Student 0:19:21: "Okay. All right."
Teacher 0:19:23: "Jay. I think it might be trying to smell or get a sense or something to figure out what it is because most of the crickets do that in cases like a danger or something. Okay."
Student 0:19:42: "Do you think he'll go inside it or go on top of it or what do you think he'll do?"
Teacher 0:19:47: "I think he's going to go inside."
Student 0:19:49: "Okay. All right. All right. Let's observe. Please put these, you can open up the cages, have your friends, have the team do it together and make sure, put the lid back on top so that the cricket doesn't hop out."

Teacher 0:20:07: Now, give it a few minutes. Let's see what happens after a few minutes. Just watch and see what it does.

Student 0:20:14: It's entering but then coming back out. It's observing its surroundings. The smaller one is behaving erratically. I believe it's trying to escape. However, the larger one is just wandering around without attempting to escape.

Teacher 0:20:34: Now, I want you to add our crickets to our terrarium. Please pay attention to all the instructions first. Are you focused on me? You're going to carefully lift the lid, empty the contents, and remove the tent. I want you to observe what happens. I will provide a lid for the containers shortly. Go ahead and place your cricket in and observe.

Student 0:21:16: I don't think we should put it in the bucket. We should put the bucket in there. What's happening? This is fascinating. It can't seem to cross the threshold. This is strange. I'm a boy named J.J. It should be caramel. Caramel is a fool, not a toy. She seems to like that. You resemble caramel. Is there a good caramel? Caramel is eating grass. I eat it. Or provide her with food. Only then will you grow larger. I eat grass. Look at it attempting to burrow under the grass. It's hiding right there. Do you think there's anything else for today? There's movement and activity everywhere. He mentioned movement and activity, and I'm echoing his observation.

Teacher 0:22:27: Good job. Go ahead and secure the lid on your terrarium. Please complete your observation on number seven. Describe their movement, actions, and where they go.

Student 0:23:00: Perhaps it's time to feed it. There's food in there.

Teacher 0:23:06: What do you think the food is?

Student 0:23:07: Grass. 

Teacher 0:23:09: Now, let's write our observations. Did you paint a vivid picture with words? Continue to work on your writing. In the meantime, who would like to share their observations?

Student 0:23:33: Initially, the cricket wandered around. It consumed some grass. Then we lost sight of it. I noticed some grass moving. It was in the dirt but managed to climb out and eat more grass. Afterward, it roamed all over the grass.

Teacher 0:23:56: Very good. You mentioned that initially, you couldn't see it in the grass. Consider what the cricket looks like. Think about the color of the grass. Can you tell me about the color of the cricket and the grass and why that's important?

Student 0:24:24: It must have been camouflaging itself to avoid predators. It could have turned itself green or brown. When it camouflages itself, it blends into the grass.

Teacher 0:24:43: Okay, he

Teacher (0:00:00): The creature blends into the grass due to its color, which is often similar to the grass and the brown of the dirt. It's hiding, isn't it? Excellent. We have been exploring crickets, so please have your books ready in your laps.

Teacher (0:25:04): Now, I want you to turn to the person next to you. You can form groups of three.

Teacher (0:25:12): Hold on, you don't know what you're going to discuss yet. I want you to share with each other the most interesting things you found about crickets. Perhaps something new you learned or something surprising. Now, turn and discuss.

Student A (0:25:38): During my observation of the crickets, I discovered something about their back legs. I didn't even know they had back legs. I also didn't know they had mandibles. The new thing I learned about insects is that I didn't see the wings on the cricket. I think the cricket was trying to rest, maybe it was tired from eating too much grass or sand.

Teacher (0:26:16): Would you like to start us off and share your findings?

Student A (0:26:22): The crickets in my team's terrarium were behaving interestingly. One was digging a hole to make its home, and the other one was exploring around the terrarium.

Teacher (0:26:36): So, one was digging a hole. Now, pick someone who wants to share or might want to comment on what you said.

Student A (0:26:47): Melissa, would you like to share?

Student Melissa (0:27:03): My cricket did almost the same thing, but it didn't dig. It hopped around on the grass. When it got on the hill, it hopped down. It was kind of funny. The cricket was a female.

Teacher (0:27:15): How do you know it was a female?

Student Melissa (0:27:17): It had something like a tube.

Teacher (0:27:24): Yes, a tube. Do you remember what that was called? No? Who remembers what that's called and can help Melissa out?

Student B (0:27:36): It's what the female uses to deliver the babies.

Teacher (0:27:41): Good job. Now, what was surprising about the cricket?

Student C (0:28:04): Ethan and I were surprised because we didn't know it could fly.

Teacher (0:28:07): Did it fly or did it jump?

Student C (0:28:10): It jumped, but I almost saw it fly. It got scared.

Teacher (0:28:18): So, the wings surprised you because you didn't think it had any. That's an interesting discovery. 

Student D (0:28:28): I was surprised every time we took our eyes off the cricket. When we looked back, it was always in a different place.

Teacher 0:28:50: Okay, all right. You guys discovered how a plant gets its food. It's a producer because it makes its own food. Now, how do you think the cricket gets its food? Does it produce its own food? How does it acquire its food?

Student 0:29:18: The cricket gets its food by eating the grass.

Teacher 0:29:23: She thinks it eats the grass. How many of you agree? Do you think that's the only plant it might eat? 

Student 0:29:34: It could also find other plants to eat, and sometimes it might eat other animals.

Teacher 0:29:41: Do you think it eats animals? How many of you think crickets only eat grass or other plants? We're going to find that out. How many of you think crickets eat grass, other animals, or other insects?

Student 0:29:56: Insects.

Teacher 0:29:57: Okay. Two of you think so. 

Student 0:29:59: Okay.

Teacher 0:30:00: So we have a couple of people who think they eat both. Do we know what we call an animal that eats both plants and animals?

Student 0:30:15: I forgot.

Teacher 0:30:18: You forgot? Okay, think about it and share again in a moment. What do we call an animal that eats both plants and other consumers, other animals?

Student 0:30:29: Omnivore.

Teacher 0:30:30: Okay, so an omnivore, that's right. What do we call an animal if it only eats meat?

Student 0:30:40: Meat eaters.

Teacher 0:30:41: Yes, they are meat eaters, but there is another word for that. Meat eaters is still correct. What else?

Student 0:30:49: Animal eaters.

Teacher 0:30:50: Okay. Carnivores. Carnivores.

Student 0:30:53: Very good.

Teacher 0:30:54: So we've got carnivores, omnivores. What if it only eats plants? What do we call those animals that eat only plants?

Student 0:31:03: Herbivores.

Teacher 0:31:06: Herbivores, good job. Now, we have begun our food chain and we're going to continue it tomorrow. I'm going to give you a word to think about and it may be a word you've heard before, it may not be. I'm going to challenge you overnight to find out what you think it might be and that word is decomposer. Don't think about it right now. I want you to check on it and tomorrow we will share.
